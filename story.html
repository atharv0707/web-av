            Our story starts from way back in mid 2024, when I, a year 12 student adds you on quick add. We didn't know each other at all and when I added you and you added me back you immediately asked "Who are you? Do I know you?". Slowly we started talking a lot to each other, and after a couple of weeks we became friends, we started sharing lots of Instagram reels and talk to each other a considerable amount.

            Then we fast forward a few months later to late December / early January of 2025. I had my A level mocks and I talked to you way less to lock in. However to my surprise, I started to miss talking to you. I was very taken a back, this was the first time in life I had ever had feelings like this. This was the first time I started to have a very small crush on you.

            After my mocks, to right before my A levels was a golden age for our friendship. We talked a lot, sometimes till late night, I rage baited you, you got rage baited, we talked about the most goofy things and we were good friends. Also, some people around me, like on the bus or people who sat close to me in school started to realise that I am texting one individual a lot. Some even said, "Oh you must be talking to a girl because no straight guy would ever text another guy so much." There were obvious signs at this point that we both liked each other more than just friends. Some of the signs which I had missed completely.

            My A levels then began and again we didn't talk to each other for a one and a half months. Then my A levels finished and at this point I had a huge crush on you but I thought the feelings were not mutual. I was scared of rejection and without warning I unadded and unfollowed you on every platform. I broke contact with you. You tried to reach out, asked for an explanation multiple times but I always aired you. I thought that rather facing rejection for asking you, I should just give up completely. This moment, although painful for me was helpful to both of us. It gave us both the time away from each other to truly consolidate our feelings for each other. Plus it adds a little tragedy to our story lol.

            The day before A level Results Day you text me again.
          </p>
          <p class="story-quote">
            "Good Luck for your A level."
          </p>
          <p>
            That text was probably one of the most important texts of our story. I realised that even though I fear rejection, I still can be good friends with you. We are still good friends and I don't want to lose that. So I add you back, follow you back and we started talking again. At first you were pissed, rightfully, and I always dogged or left your questions unanswered. But after a few days we both came back to what we were: Good friends. We talked a lot sent a lot of reels to each other stuff like that.

            Towards the end of August one late night you tell me you have a question but you are afraid to ask it. Obviously I would be very intrigued as to whatever this question is. I think I knew deep down what the question was. After days and days of repeatedly asking you questions we came to a compromise. I would send you a video of Radhaan, a cute little child, saying your name in exchange for you asking me the question.
          </p>

        <div class="story-section">
          <p>
            I did it. I sent the video and you did in fact ask your question:
          </p>
          <p class="story-quote">
            "Do you see us as more than friends?"
          </p>
          <p>
            This text was the second most important text in our whole story. At the time you send that I was on call with my friends yapping and I read it. Slowly everyone on that call knew the situation and me and my friends started debating about what I should say, if I was going to get rejected or not. I stalled and you assumed that I wasn't going to answer so you tried sending reels instead to ease the tension. Eventually my friends convinced me to confess and I did. You read the message and left me on seen for 5 mins. Those 5 mins felt like the longest 5 mins of my life. I thought this is it she's gonna block me, call me weird and reject me. However you said <span class="story-highlight">"well guess what, the feelings are mutual."</span> I was genuinely so gassed and I told my friends too because they were on call with me. I'm not even joking every single guy was shouting YESSSS and they were gassed for me. That night was the best and I couldn't sleep because of the raw excitement I had for the future.

            From that point onward we started to see each other differently, we cleared up from the beginning that we are here for the long term, not temporarily. We were serious from the beginning and we also started to share our vulnerabilities we became very close to each other. We told our parents earlier than most about us and how serious we are. We became physically attached to each other too and now we tell each other everything, whether it is small or big and of course we flirt a lot.

            Sometimes we argue, we fight but at the end of the day we come back and fight for our relationship. We become stronger as a couple and our bond strengthens. No matter what happens I will always be there for you. No one can pull me away from you. I am yours and yours only. These last few months with you, ever since we confessed, have been incredible.
