I love how you're becoming more vocal, I love how you always want to be with me physically, I love how you send me lots of reels and give me songs to listen to, I love how you show genuine interest in things you have no idea about but because I am interested you are willing to listen and contribute. <span class="story-highlight">I love and am extremely grateful for everything you do for me.</span>

            You make me feel so comfortable, like at home kind of feeling. You make me want to share my vulnerabilities with you, you let me crash out at you to make me feel better, you let me let down my guard, you make me always want to come close to you, hold you and hug you. I feel like I can truly be myself around you and that we understand each other very well. <span class="story-highlight">In your embrace, I find my sanctuary.</span>

I want you to also feel fully comfortable around me, I want you to have that romantic life you have been fantasizing about, I want to be your lover and travel the world with you. I want to try really hard because if it makes you smile, then it is worth it. I want to be there for you, as your biggest fan, your biggest supporter, biggest well wisher. I don't care in what state you are, whether your crying tears of joy or sadness, whether your well or sick, whether you think you looked chopped or not, <span class="story-highlight">I will always be the person you can run to for help, for physical affection, for warmth, for love, no matter what.</span>
